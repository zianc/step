                My home base for the next two years is in Los Angeles, California,
                where I attend UCLA. Although Los Angeles can seem glamorous, our
                school is located in Westwood and is neither a part of the hustle
                and bustle of the big city nor a part of the wealthy neighborhood
                of Beverly Hills. That being said, the area is still very nice.

                I've lived in Los Gatos, California for about 10 years. I went
                to elementary, middle, and high school year, ultimately capping
                off my years at Los Gatos High School. The town is small but
                has a cozy downtown area and a fantastic park.

                I moved to Toronto when I was edging near a year old. I 
                don't quite remember that much since I moved away when I was 
                seven, but I do distinctly remember the tons of snow and our 
                little apartment in the city. My dad spent his time getting his
                PhD at the University of Toronto.

                I was born in Putian, China--a little rural village along the
                southern coast of the continent. Although I didn't live here,
                I'm fortunate enough to be able to go back home and visit from
                time to time. My grandmother always makes sure to whisk up a 
                lot of seafood for me to eat, ensuring that I always leave the 
                country with a couple extra pounds on my body...
