                            Thanks for dropping by! My name is Zian Chen, a 
                            soon-to-be third year student at UCLA, working to 
                            get a Bachelor's in Computer Science. My path to 
                            where I am now has not been easy, but along the way 
                            I've picked up multiple different skills and, 
                            arguably more importantly, how to deal with failure, 
                            learn the value of criticism, and rely not only on 
                            myself but those around me. Keep scrolling to track a 
                            few stops along the way!

                            SWE Dev was the first organization I joined and the 
                            one that taught me how to learn from the bottom up. 
                            In order to build our club's Event Portal, I worked 
                            on both the front and backend, primarily learning 
                            React and PostgreSQL to do so. I deal with a lot of 
                            categorical data that we use to improve useability.

                            I worked on the Tech Team to assist in hosting one 
                            of the largest hackathons in the nation; in fact, 
                            our virtual hackathon this year attracted over 1,000 
                            participants. My contributions included designing 
                            and implementing the entire frontend for our website 
                            and live site in React, working to learn and develop 
                            the large code base and backend (written in Go and 
                            using PostgreSQL), and handle the technical transition 
                            to a virtual format. Next year, I will be taking on 
                            the position of Tech Director.

                            I spent a quarter at UCLA working on a Creative Labs 
                            project called Pinstagrad, which aimed to help improve 
                            rising seniors' graduation photo experience. I worked 
                            primarily as a backend dev, using Go and Firebase to 
                            store images. I also briefly dabbled in the frontend 
                            towards the end of the quarter, which used React. Not 
                            only did I pick up those skills, I also learned quite a 
                            bit about working in a small team and picked up tips on 
                            how to lead one successfully.
